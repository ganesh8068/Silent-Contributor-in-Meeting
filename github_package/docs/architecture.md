# Silent Contributor Detector - Solution Architecture

## Overview

The Silent Contributor Detector is a web application designed to identify and analyze engagement of participants who may not speak much during meetings but contribute in other ways. The application tracks voice participation, analyzes cross-modal contributions, generates engagement scores, includes a nudging system, and provides a dashboard view.

## System Architecture

The application follows a modern web architecture with a Flask backend and React frontend:

## Core Components

### 1. Voice Participation Tracker
- **Audio Processing Module**: Analyzes meeting audio to identify speakers and measure speaking time
- **Speaker Identification**: Uses voice fingerprinting to identify who is speaking
- **Silence Detection**: Identifies participants who haven't spoken or have minimal speaking time
- **Integration with Meeting Platforms**: Connects to popular meeting platforms via APIs

### 2. Cross-Modal Contribution Analyzer
- **Chat Analysis Module**: Processes meeting chat logs to identify text-based contributions
- **Document Collaboration Tracker**: Analyzes shared documents for contributions
- **Task Management Integration**: Connects to task management tools to track follow-up actions
- **Data Aggregation Engine**: Combines data from multiple sources for comprehensive analysis

### 3. Engagement Score System
- **Scoring Algorithm**: Calculates engagement scores based on multiple factors
- **Weighting System**: Applies configurable weights to different types of contributions
- **Historical Analysis**: Tracks engagement trends over time
- **Comparative Analysis**: Compares individual engagement to team averages

### 4. Nudging System
- **Alert Generator**: Creates notifications for managers about silent contributors
- **Suggestion Engine**: Provides contextual suggestions for encouraging participation
- **Scheduling Module**: Times nudges appropriately during or after meetings
- **Feedback Loop**: Tracks the effectiveness of nudges over time

### 5. Dashboard View
- **Visualization Module**: Creates charts and graphs of participation data
- **Team Overview**: Shows team-level metrics and trends
- **Individual Profiles**: Displays detailed information about each participant
- **Report Generator**: Creates exportable reports for stakeholders

## Data Flow

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Meeting audio/video streams are processed in real-time
   - Chat logs and document activities are captured through APIs
   - Task management data is synchronized periodically

2. **Data Processing**:
   - Audio is analyzed for speaker identification and speaking time
   - Text contributions are processed for content and engagement metrics
   - All data is normalized and stored in the database

3. **Analysis & Scoring**:
   - Engagement scores are calculated based on all available data
   - Historical trends are analyzed
   - Anomalies and patterns are identified

4. **Presentation & Action**:
   - Dashboard is updated with latest metrics
   - Nudges are generated based on analysis
   - Reports are made available to stakeholders

## Technical Stack

### Backend
- **Framework**: Flask (Python)
- **Database**: MySQL for structured data
- **Audio Processing**: WebRTC, TensorFlow for voice analysis
- **API Integration**: REST APIs for external services
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui components
